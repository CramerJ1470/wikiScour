# wikiScour
A simple react program to scour data from wikipedia pages. this on is for colleges.

for any college see format in public/index.html and change url to college accordingly.

as we develop this app further we will chnage this to build a local api with college details to be used in sorting college data based on certain criteria.

have fun!!!
